  - review: Quick and helpful response. Identified the problem with the boiler
      quickly and after a long slog of pushing air out of the system had my
      heating running better than since I bought it.

      boiler issues and central heating flushing.

  - review: A brilliant and honest service. This was the first time our 12 year old
      boiler had been serviced properly. Our previous contractor had been
      ripping us off year after year without us twigging.

  - review: Very speedy response. I emailed James on a Sunday and he responded that
      day and came to fix the problem the following day. It was a relatively
      minor problem but this was fixed successfully. Would recommend.

  - review: Had to call someone in late in the day, he came to the store quick and
      assessed the situation and let me know how long it would take. He was
      quick tidy and nice. Definitely will call him again when needed.

  - review: James from the beginning was very interested in the job to be done. He
      enthusiastically suggested a method which I agreed to. He ordered new
      pieces to replace damaged electrical parts, took the lamp away to his
      workshop and returned it working again. The number of days taken is
      irrelevant as parts had to be ordered. We were very pleased with this
      contract and would certainly recommend Heritage Heating to everyone
      requiring electrical work to be done.

  - review: The job was trickier than we thought but James kept me up to date and
      took time to explain everything. The end result was just what we were
      wanting.

      reliable engineer! The work was to the highest standard and we couldn't be
      happier.
