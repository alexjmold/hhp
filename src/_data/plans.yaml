faqs:
  - question: What does an annual boiler service include?
    answer: During a boiler service, we will carry out a series of checks to ensure
      that your boiler and central heating are running safely and efficiently.
      We will check for water leaks, as well as any damage and wear and tear.
      We'll also carry out several safety inspections to make sure that your
      boiler is using the right amount of gas and not letting off carbon
      monoxide or other harmful gasses.
  - question: How do I book my annual boiler service?
    answer: We will get in touch before your annual service is due so that you can
      book a time slot for our engineer to carry out the service. If at any
      point you'd like to book in a service, please just get in touch.
  - question: What is a Cover Plan and why do I need one?
    answer: A Cover Plan provides you with assistance should your boiler break down
      and affect your home's heating and hot water supply. It also helps you to
      spread the cost of your annual boiler service. You can have full peace of
      mind knowing we're just a call away when you need us.
